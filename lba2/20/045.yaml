message: Once, long ago, our god, Dark Monk, condemned us, the people of
  Zeelich, to live forever on our planet which he then turned into hell so as to
  make it seem more of a real condemnation. Each of the four races received a
  fragment of a key. These must be reunited during a great ceremony. And when
  our people have atoned for their sins, Dark Monk will rid us of the curse and
  give Zeelich back its original appearance. Today, he's returned and we all
  await the next and last ceremony. Twinsen, do not dare interfere with the
  religious practice of our people.
