message: "Then Dark Monk came back and announced the latest verdict from the
  Gods. The races were to fraternize and share the task of returning Zeelich to
  its former beauty. He unveiled a great wonder: from the deadly cloud, hideous
  monsters were born and threatened to invade the planet. But, thanks to his
  Key, Dark Monk also gave rise to a volcano which erupted and sculpted in
  basalt a gigantic statue in his image, holding the Stone Book of the 10,000
  Names. At each ceremony, lightning would henceforth inscribe once more the
  Name of God, Dark Monk. Before disappearing, Dark Monk broke his Key into 4
  pieces and thus revealed the Great Prophecy. On the day when the 10,000th Name
  of God is engraved the reunion of the 4 fragments of the Key will make the
  monsters and the gas disappear, and will give back to Zeelich the heavenly
  appearance of its origin. Life will then be reborn as it was in the time of
  Eden."
