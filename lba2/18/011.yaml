message: "In the beginning, the 2 mother planets, Zeer (the sun) and Lich (the
  cold) met one another during the Oogh: the great cataclysm. From this Zeelich
  was born. Life appeared and the brotherhood of the Gods sent there the
  youngest son of the light, who was called Kard N'kom. Alas, some deleterious
  fumes emanating from the Great Sulfur Mine disfigured him. His horribly
  mutilated face escaped the Gods, and it was decided that Kard N'kom would have
  to forever hide his face and never again appear in front of the noble
  assembly. Condemned to roam the cosmos forever, Kard N'kom saw his Name erased
  from the divine law. He who wanders without a face became then known as Dark
  Monk... Zeelich was populated with 4 different races, condemned by the Gods to
  fight each other forever. But, life being stronger, the divine brotherhood
  hurled Zeelich into the first sun of the Novae system. This shock created the
  planet such as we know it: a blanket of clouds isolating the rocky summits
  from the melting ground."
