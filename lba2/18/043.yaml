message: At last we meet again, Twinsen! But this time, you are too late!! With
  the emperor's help, I succeeded in deceiving the Esmers. Ironic, isn't it?
  They mistook me for the reincarnation of Dark Monk and granted me divine
  powers that even I didn't possess. Thanks to those Esmers, these powers will
  be mine as soon as the moon collides with Twinsun!!
