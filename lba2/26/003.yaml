message: Twinsen...Oh Twinsen, it's me, Sendell!!! Twinsen, a cosmic cataclysm
  is on its way!!! The moon has started to move! Soon, it is going to hurl
  itself against Twinsun, destroying our planet!!! You must stop Dark Monk and
  prevent him from using that infernal machine he built inside the statue. With
  it, he could attract and steal the energy that we could use to stop the
  moon!!! You must get the four key fragments, which are used in the ceremony
  and are protected by the Esmer races. With these fragments the statue of Dark
  Monk will emerge from the crater!! Once you stop Dark Monk, you will have to
  come back to Twinsun and, in the Well of the Sendells, I will help you stop
  the moon!!
