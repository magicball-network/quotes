  Twinsunian, Dark Monk is unbeatable. In his statue, he has built a machine
  capable of storing the magical energy that he intends to steal from your
  planet!!!

  My agents went to Twinsun to kidnap your wizards since we needed them to
  attract the energy from your planet to Zeelich. But we were forced to kidnap
  the children because the wizards refused to cooperate!!

  You were our only obstacle. But now, we have won. The destruction of Twinsun
  and the use of the machine will intervene during the next ceremony. And you
  cannot prevent me from triggering the lunar reactors!!!
