  It's over Twinsen, you lost. To make your defeat even more bitter, I am going
  to tell you the truth.

  With all these beliefs, I was not master of my own planet, people had only
  ears for Dark Monk's priests!! One day, a stranger landed on Zeelich and
  offered to pass himself off as Dark Monk. Together, we spread the belief that
  he was to fulfill the great prophecy. Of course, this is far from the truth.

  I don't know why, but Dark Monk wants to appropriate the magical energy
  contained in your planet. And, since I want to become the master of Zeelich,
  we made a deal!!!
