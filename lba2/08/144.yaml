message: This storm...I wanted to get rid of it but the lighthouse was closed
  and I can't find the keeper anywhere. Only he could help me reach the top of
  the building where I have the view I need to utter a conjuration. It's the
  only way to stop this storm that neutralizes the island. But I need the
  lighthouse keeper.
