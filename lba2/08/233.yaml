  People from the planet Twinsun, we come to you in a spirit of peace.

  Thank you for dispersing this storm which prevented us from landing. We have
  observed your planet for many cycles now and have decided to come and study
  your culture on the spot. We have traveled through Space solely with the goal
  of discovering your civilization.
