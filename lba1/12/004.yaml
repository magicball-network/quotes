message: "Very strange indeed. I'm just an old fool who would like to grow
  flowers in the desert, but... I know about this Legend that Dr. FunFrock
  forbade. I'll tell you what I know if you bring me a sacred book. It is in the
  Temple of BÃ¹ which was buried by a violent sand storm. You can still get in,
  however, through one of the ventilation shafts still visible just behind me.
  But be careful: there is danger everywhere!"
