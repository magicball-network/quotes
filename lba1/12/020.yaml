message: "Only the Heir could have survived in that Temple! You are the Chosen
  One that the prophecy spoke of. You are worthy of keeping the Book of BÃ¹,
  Twinsen. It will allow you to decipher the runes and to speak to the animals.
  The prophecy that must be accomplished is also revealed in its pages: you must
  overthrow Dr. FunFrock, the despot who has destroyed the harmony that once
  existed on this planet. In my dreams, I saw him profaning the Well of Sendell,
  which caused the immediate destruction of this world. You must go to the Well
  of Sendell to save us from Dr. FunFrock. I don't know where this well is, but
  your ancestors must have left instructions for you, somewhere in your home."
