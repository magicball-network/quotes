message: "You know Julia? She is a nice girl. She watches a bit too much TV, but
  there is some truth in her story: someone left a box for clover leaves on the
  islet in front of my house. It is too shallow for a boat to get there by
  water, and since the bridge leading to the islet has collapsed, the only way
  to get there is to fly."
