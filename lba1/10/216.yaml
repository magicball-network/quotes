message: 'According to the book I have, there is a "Clear water" lake in the
  Hamalayi mountains, somewhere to the North West of Principal Island. Did you
  know that the Hamalayi range is impossible to cross? It marks the border with
  the Northern hemisphere, the one that Dr. FunFrock cleared out. The sun is too
  hot for us over there: the temperature is unbearable, and the changes in
  climate caused the development of mutant monsters. And despite the fact that
  the good doctor spared us from all that, there are still rebels out there who
  want to overthrow him - it''s shameful!'
