message: '"In the distant past, when the spheros, rabbibunnies, Quetches and
  grobos emerged from the original primordial soup, centuries before Dr.
  FunFrock''s coup, a prophecy was pronounced. Its text is hardly remembered
  today and that is why people now refer to it as the "Legend". It explained
  how "the Heir," when his time had come, would be called to overthrow a
  tyrant! The secret of the Legend can still be learned somewhere in the White
  Leaf Desert."'
