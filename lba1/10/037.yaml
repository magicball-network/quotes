message: "This young girl must be someone important if that tyrant FunFrock is
  holding her outside of Citadel Island. Something funny is going on with this
  forbidding of any talk about the Legend: this must be some kind of weakness in
  his power! Find out what is behind this Legend, it's your only hope of seeing
  your friend again. If you need to leave the island, I know a friend who can
  help you at Port-Belooga (check your holomap). Tell him that I sent you. And
  be discreet in your quest."
