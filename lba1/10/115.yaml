  I've got to tell you something. It's awful! My best friend (Beatrice) is in
  love with Steven. But Paul, Steven's half brother, left Cindy when Linda got
  out of the clinic after her bobsleigh accident. But not for Linda, for
  Tatjana! Only Serge (who secretly admires Steven) has been trying for months
  to win the love of Tatjana who refuses to talk to Christy since she died. All
  the while Stephanie - who remarried Serge - discovered the letter from Paulina
  in which she explained where was the box of clover leaves left behind by Roy.
  So, evidently, Beatrice wonders if Linda knows about the accident.

  You get all that?
