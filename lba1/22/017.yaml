message: "Good day. Let's see, you can talk to me and you're wearing the
  Medallion of Sendell: you must be the Heir! I've been waiting for you for
  centuries and I've got a backache so we'll go carefully. The Hamalayi
  mountains are too high for me but I can lead you through this entire
  hemisphere, except for Polar island: it is too well guarded by FunFrock. Where
  do you want to go?"
