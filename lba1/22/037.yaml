  are still a few people that resist like here in Funky-Town. He produces mutant
  insects in his factory at the foot of the Hamalayi mountains to exterminate
  us. The factory was supposedly sabotaged, but there are still monsters in the
  sewers: they were produced before the sabotage. In fact, you can jump on the
  giant crabs!"
