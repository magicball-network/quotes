  You must be Twinsen. Like you, we have rebelled against that madman FunFrock -
  and you saw what's left of the city.

  We don't believe that the Northern hemisphere has become uninhabitable like
  the propaganda says it has. There may even be some survivors living there who
  refused to be deported. This is why we have decided to take the road leading
  to the Okojo pass by force. It leads to the Northern hemisphere.
  Unfortunately, our leader, Colonel Kroptman, was captured during the attack.
  We believe that he is still being held in the small fort that guards the pass.
  Help us free him by raiding the fort. You will be able to get to the Northern
  hemisphere if you do so. Go back to the hangar, there is a commando waiting
  for you in the boat.
