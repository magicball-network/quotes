message: "We're going to help you take the fort: you will guide me, and I'll
  follow you with my grenades! Whatever you do, wait for me before you change
  zones and don't forget to neutralize the emitter. We won't talk during the
  combats and if I bite it, another rebel will come and take my place, he'll
  wait for you at the landing site."
