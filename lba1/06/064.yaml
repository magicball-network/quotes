  " To find Captain LeBorgne's treasure, the voyager who arrives at the port of
  Proxima island must use the closest mooring post as a guide. With his back to
  the docked boats, he must follow these instructions in DISCREET mode:

  6 steps to the North (straight ahead), then 6 steps to the East (to his
  right), following the gradual slope. 2 steps to the North (straight ahead)
  until he reaches the metal garbage can, 3 steps to the East (to his right)
  until he arrives at a light post. He must stand EXACTLY between the 2 lamp
  posts, and then take 8 steps to the North until he arrives at a gate. Captain
  LeBorgne's treasure is in the building behind the gate."
