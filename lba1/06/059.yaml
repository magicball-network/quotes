  Twinsun is a relatively new planet on the outskirts of a remote galaxy. It's
  rotational plane has stabilized between two suns.

  There is a huge mountain range running along its equator, that divides the
  planet in half; each hemisphere is warmed by a single sun.

  The Northern hemisphere, with its orange sky, is warmer than the Southern
  hemisphere. Except for a polar region, the planet's climate is clement. The
  formation of life forms on the planet was thus favorable. Four species
  developed over the course of the centuries: The Spheros, the Rabbibunnies, the
  Quetches and the Grobos. They all lived in harmony until a tyrant named Dr.
  FunFrock reared his ugly head.
