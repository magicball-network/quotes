  "The day will come when someone from the present or future species will rise
  up and say,

  'This world is mine from now on, and the key to all powers belongs to me!'

  This day will surely come because avarice and violence harbor in the hearts of
  all species of the universe. If the peril on this day is too great, the Chosen
  One will come forth. He will rise up against the tyrant and overthrow him. He
  will free and reunite the people, because throughout the years, the Chosen
  One's ancestors will have prepared him for his victory. They will have left
  information and weapons in his dwelling. The Chosen One, also known as the
  Heir, will, however, have to gather together four magical symbols if he hopes
  to be victorious: the Tunic, the Book of BÃ¹, Sendell's Medallion and a Flask
  of Clear Water. On the day of peril Sendell will visit the Heir in his sleep
  and announce the coming of the final combat. The Heir will then have to go to
  the Well of Sendell where the goddess will endow her powers on him! "
