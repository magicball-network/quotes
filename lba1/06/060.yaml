  Ever since FunFrock's rise to power, the population has been living under a
  reign of terror. FunFrock set up a police state where suspicion is
  omnipresent. He is all powerful and controls the people with an iron fist. He
  has at his disposal two high tech weapons that insure his power: cloning and
  teleportation.

  He can clone any of the species at will, and subsequently recruit these clones
  into his ranks. He can then deploy these clones instantly through a network of
  telepods that are dispersed over the entire planet.
