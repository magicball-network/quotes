message: You must break the seal so that I can enter the Well of Sendell. None
  of my machines could drill through this rock, it resists me, just like the
  Runic Stone. I began digging around the rocky peak, but it will take months
  for me to reach the center of the planet! You'll see, I will realize the
  prophecy myself, and I'll take good care of this planet. Break the seal and
  I'll spare you Twinsen, you and your friend.
