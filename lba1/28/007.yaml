message: I am Sendell, like all of those you see here, we are all Sendells. We
  are here to watch over a stellar entity that is in gestation, it will come
  into existence in a few centuries. As we can only act from the heart of the
  planet, we implanted a lineage of elected creatures among the species living
  on the surface. You are the current descendant of this family, and when
  FunFrock's threat had become too great, it was me that called to you in your
  dreams. The entity can now finish its gestation because you rid us of
  FunFrock. It would have died if he had gotten to it, and this world would have
  imploded, thanks to you it will continue to flourish. Return now to the
  surface, you can now erase the final traces that he left there.
