message: I've been working on a Jet-Pack prototype for days now. It's a small
  reactor that harnesses onto your back and allows you to fly about. My problem
  is that my last test flight wreaked a bit of havoc on the garden wall. It is
  rather difficult to fine tune the motor's power. I need a rheostat like the
  one you find in a hair dryer. Do you think you can find one of those for me?
