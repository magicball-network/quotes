  Well you can believe me if you want, but the museum is well protected! I just
  connected this button to the alarm system: the building is evacuated as soon
  as it is pressed.

  Only one or two automatic guards will remain. It also sets off a series of
  sensors under the wooden floor that will sound the alarm as soon as they
  detect even the slightest weight. You would have to be able to fly to move
  around in there!
