message: I've been working on a Jet-Pack prototype for days now. It's a small
  reactor that is harnessed on the back and allows its user to fly about. My
  problem is that my latest flight test wreaked havoc on my Southern wall. So
  I'd like to borrow the rheostat in your hair dryer to fine tune the power of
  the motors (from looking at your hairdo, I don't think you really need the
  dryer, anyway). And if that works, I will have a job offer for you.
