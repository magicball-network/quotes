  generations to help the Heir who will, one day, be chosen from our
  descendants. The key to the room was passed down from generation to
  generation, but our ancestor Hégésippe was the last family member to retain
  the key. He was attacked and killed by the ruthless pirate LeBorgne during a
  sea voyage. Nobody knows where Leborgne''s treasure, which undoubtedly contains
  the golden key to the room, is today."'
