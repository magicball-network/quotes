message: I can't open this chest with this blasted trick back of mine! Gimme a
  hand and I'll let you keep some of what's inside. All you have to do is move
  in front of the chest while in normal mode and use the ACTION command. You can
  do the same for rummaging through lots of things like cupboards, garbage cans,
  etc...
