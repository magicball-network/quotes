  world. Their locations are now indicated on your Holomap. They are large
  menhirs with runic text written on them. They will help the Heir in his quest
  for Sendell. The third stone will show the exact location of the Well of
  Sendell. In addition to the help provided by the text, each stone conceals a
  secret."'
