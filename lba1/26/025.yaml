message: I know that symbol on your medallion. Virgul, our sorcerer, told us
  about your coming, and we have often prayed in front of the Runic Stone, which
  carries the same symbol. Unfortunately, Dr. FunFrock found it and built his
  fortress right over it, although the Rock was supposed to be indestructible! I
  would dig a tunnel for you so that you could enter the building, but you must
  first sabotage the Teleportation Center. Go find the plans of this center, I
  can dig only after all the telepods have been neutralized!
