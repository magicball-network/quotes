  I have you at last! I see that you appreciated the clone that I made of your
  friend, the original is safe.

  I suppose that you have come here to find the 3rd Runic Stone. I already found
  it a long time ago, but it took some time to decipher it. And as soon as I
  knew the location of the Well of Sendell, I began the foraging work.
