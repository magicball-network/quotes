  Not being able to destroy the stone, I built my fortress around it to
  dissimulate it. That reminds me, you supposedly destroyed two of my factories,
  but that is of little importance! I will soon possess such fantastic powers,
  that I will need but an instant to clone or teleport the totality of the
  inhabitants of the planet. I also can make you relive the worst moments of
  your existence indefinitely...

  Good bye, you will never realize the prophecy because I will be the one who
  encounters Sendell and I will inherit her powers.
